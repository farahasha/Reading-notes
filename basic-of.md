# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## 1.Text Elements


- There are 19 elements for text in HTML:

<br>

### 1.1 : Headings

we use :
                                
  ```html

  ```

### 1.4 : Superscript & Subscript

  ```html
    for Superscript <sup></sup> and for Subscript <sub> </sub>
  ```

### 1.5 : White Space

```html

  ```

### 1.12 : Changes to Content

```html

## 2. Introducing CSS

- ### We can Understand CSS by Thinking Inside the Box as the following:

    CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears insideits own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

- ### What the rules are made of
     Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
    
    
- ### The Selectors and declerations are
    - **The Selectors** : Different types of selectors allow you to target your
    rules at different elements.
    
    - **the Declarations** are made up of two parts: the properties
    of the element that you want to change, and the values
    of those properties. For example, the font-family
    property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
    specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

- We can link the css code with html elements in tow ways are:
    - **Using Inline CSS**
        ```html
        <p style="color:blue;"></p>
        ```
   
    - **Using Internal CSS**
        ```html
        <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
        ``` 

    - **Using External CSS**:
        ```html
        <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
        ```

- ### The Meaning of Inheritance is :
every element is a perant and has its child when you apply a styling to the perant you do the childs also by default.

## 3. Basic JavaScript Instructions
                                
- ### What a script is:
    
    - A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
    Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
    Statements should end with a semicolon.

    - Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
    you might specify that a value must be remembered
    before creating a calculation using that value.

- ### What the variable is:
    
    - A script will have to temporarily store the bits of info rmation it needs to do its job. It can store t his data in variables.

    - Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
    information used in the script.

    - We declare them then we assign a value to it.

    - data types are number, strings and boolean.

- ### What the Array are:
    - An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
    - Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information .

- ### What the expression is: 
    - An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
    there are two types of expressions.
        - Expressions evaluate into a single value.
        - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.


## 4. Decisions and Loops

    in this part we will discuss the following points

- What is the condtional statment.
- What are the comparasion operators.
- What are the logical operators.
- What is the if statement.
- What is the switch statement.
 -How Data types coerced from one type to anothe
 -What are the types of loops statatments .
  

- ### The Condtional Statement is :
    Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

- ### The comparasion operators are:
    Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- ### The logical operators are:
    Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- ### What the if statement is :
    if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- ### What the switch statement is:
    - A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

    - switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).

- ### How Data types can be coerced from one type to another
    - Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
    - All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

- ### What the types of loops statatments are.
    There are three types of loop: for, while, and
    do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
