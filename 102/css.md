# CSS
 is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

  
 ** CSS MEAN: **
  
  is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files.


  ** There are three ways you can use to implement CSS: **
  
  * internal
  *  external
  * inline styles

  CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
1. Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
2. Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.
3. External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.
