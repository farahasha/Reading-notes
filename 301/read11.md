## Mongo and Mongoose

SQL | NoSQL
------------ | -------------
databases are relational | databases are non-relational
Cuse structured query language and have a predefined schema | dynamic schemas for unstructured data
vertically scalable | horizontally scalable
databases are table-based | databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
databases are better for multi-row transactions | better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

### Give a real world example.


### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

So, if your application requires high availability and scalability, a NoSQL Database built on BASE properties might be suitable. Choose NoSQL if you have or need: Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema. Limited pre-defined access paths and query patterns

### Give a real world example.


### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.

### Which type of database is best for scalability?
First of all, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, all are highly scalable, it's just that they require little maintenance for it. All SQL based databases are very stable, and are in production since years.

### What does SQL stand for?

SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.

### What is a realational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.

### What is a ‘schema’?

Retrieved November 26, 2012. A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects. 

### What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL is a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first - an alternative

### How does it work?

NoSQL is an approach to databases that represents a shift away from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). ... Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models.

### What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability
