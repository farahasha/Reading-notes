### What is a ‘call’?

The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method. It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter). With call() , an object can use a method belonging to another object.


### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

On a page you can have as many setTimeouts/setIntervals running at once as you wish

### What does LIFO mean?

A stack data structure follows the same principle and it's called a LIFO data structure. LIFO means last in first out, the same way as a stack of dinner plates or other types of the stack in the real world works—the most recent element added to the stack should be the first out.


### Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

### What causes a Stack Overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error. ... The callMyself() will run until the browser throws a “Maximum call size exceeded

### What is a ‘refrence error’?

In JavaScript, a reference error is thrown when a code attempts to reference a non-existing variable

### What is a ‘syntax error’?

The SyntaxError object represents an error when trying to interpret syntactically invalid code. It is thrown when the JavaScript engine encounters tokens or token order that does not conform to the syntax of the language when parsing code

### What is a ‘range error’?

Description. A RangeError is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value. This can be encountered when: passing a value that is not one of the allowed string values to String.

### What is a ‘tyep error’?

The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type. A TypeError may be thrown when: an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function; or.

### What is a breakpoint?

At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).

### What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function. This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger. ... With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line.
