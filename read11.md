## CHARTS

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

To see how to use chart.js we’re going to create a set of 3 graphs; one will show the number of buyers a fictional product has over the course of 6 months, this will be a line chart; the second will show which countries the customers come from, this will be the pie chart; finally we’ll use a bar chart to show profit over the period.

## The <canvas> element

At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted

The <canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for <video>, <audio>, or <picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.

Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the <canvas> element. Browsers that don't support <canvas> will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support <canvas> will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.


### The rendering context

The <canvas> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context. Other contexts may provide different types of rendering; for example, WebGL uses a 3D context based on OpenGL ES.

The canvas is initially blank. To display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. The <canvas> element has a method called getContext(), used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions. getContext() takes one parameter, the type of context. For 2D graphics, such as those covered by this tutorial, you specify "2d" to get a CanvasRenderingContext2D.

`var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');`
`var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');`



### Drawing shapes with canvas

**The grid**

Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.

## Colors

Up until now we have only seen methods of the drawing context. If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.

fillStyle = color
Sets the style used when filling shapes.
strokeStyle = color
Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
color is a string representing a CSS <color>, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value #000000).

## Drawing text

Drawing text
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

>fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
>Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
>strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
>Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
