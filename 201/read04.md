# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions


## HTML Links

**- What is HTML Links:**  
 * Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.  


* *HTML* links are **hyperlinks**.

* You can click on a link and jump to another document.

* When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

* A link does not have to be text, a link can be an image or any other *HTML* element.


**- HTML Links - Syntax:** The *HTML* `<a>` tag defines a **hyperlink**. It has the following syntax:
```
<a href="url">link text</a>
```
* it will be like this [link text]()
* The most important attribute of the `<a>` element is the `href` attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

* The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

* Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

## CSS Layout

**- CSS Layout:** A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer as shown below:

* There are many different layout designs, however the structure above is one of the most common structure used.    

  

* The CSS website layout components:
1. Header: A header is usually located at the top of the website (or right below a top navigation menu). It often contains a logo or the website name.

2. Navigation Bar: A navigation bar contains a list of links to help visitors navigating through your website.

3. Content: The layout in this section, often depends on the target users interest.

4. Footer: The footer is placed at the bottom of your page. It often contains information like copyright and contact info.


## JavaScript Functions

**- What is JavaScript Functions:** 
* A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
* A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

**- JavaScript Function Syntax:** 
*A JavaScript function is defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses **()**.

* Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

* The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
**(parameter1, parameter2, ...)**

* The code to be executed, by the *function*, is placed inside curly brackets: **{}**
 
* The typical formula (Syntax) will be as shown below:
```
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```
* Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
* Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
* Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

**- Function Invocation:** The code inside the function will execute when "something" **invokes** (calls) the function:
* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button).
* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code.
* Automatically (self invoked).

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. 
pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.

### How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.


### Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

During a five-hour paired lab session, Code Fellows students work on all four of these language-specific skills. The abilities they foster will serve them well in completing assignments, in their own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice.

Wow, all that? Let’s take a look!

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
