## How does an HTML Form work?

- Your visitor loads the form page in her web browser. The browser sends a request to the web server. 
- Your visitor fills the form and submits it. .
- The form submission data is sent to the web server.
- The web server processes the request. 
- A response is sent back to the browser.

### Password Input

\<input>
type="password" When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except
the characters are blocked out. They are hidden in this way so that if someone is looking over the user's shoulder, they cannot
see sensitive data such as passwords.

**name**
The name attribute indicates the name of the password input, which is sent to the server with the password the user enters.

**size, maxlength**
It can also carry the size and maxlength attributes like the the single-line text input.

## Events

> Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired. For example, if the user selects a button on a webpage, you might want to respond to that action by displaying an information box. In this article, we discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at how they work in browsers. This won't be an exhaustive study; just what you need to know at this stage.
