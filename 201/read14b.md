## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

You would expect **Google** to do the search for “what makes great teams?” better than most anyone. These masters of search and analysis were on a quest some years back with that question in mind. Google was motivated by research that shows work together in groups `“tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems”`.

**Google** was ideally positioned for this quest and set about the process of discovery by looking first in their own nest. the company pulled together researchers under the code name “Project Aristotle” with the mission to study hundreds of Google teams looking for the code, the pattern, the magic ingredient. Google isn’t the first company to want to solve that puzzle. Decades of research has focused on trying to isolate the formula.

It starts with a clear understanding that the team is a system and, as all systems do, behavioral norms are created to protect the system and its function. Norms represent the rules of survival and success for that team, that system. Norms become visible in action team members take, or avoid taking. In the Team model, we look  categories to identify team norms. By looking closely at these 14 engaging the team in conversation

If the goal is improved performance and team norms are the key, it makes sense to get clear about what’s working and what’s not working in order to implement changes. You can’t change what you can’t see so the very first step in improving team performance is to look at the current state—the operating conditions under which the team abides. Where is the team today? What’s working? What’s not working? Google accurately identified behavioral norms as the key to creating effective teams. provides a way to see the norms in action and for the team to talk about the impact.

`in late 2014, Rozovsky and her fellow Project Aristotle number-crunchers began sharing their findings with select groups of Google’s 51,000 employees. By then, they had been collecting surveys, conducting interviews and analyzing statistics for almost three years. They hadn’t yet figured out how to make psychological safety easy, but they hoped that publicizing their research within Google would prompt employees to come up with some ideas of their own.`

After Rozovsky gave one presentation, a trim, athletic man named Matt Sakaguchi approached the Project Aristotle researchers. Sakaguchi had an unusual background for a Google employee. Twenty years earlier, he was a member of a SWAT team in Walnut Creek, Calif., but left to become an electronics salesman and eventually landed at Google as a midlevel manager, where he has overseen teams of engineers who respond when the company’s websites or servers go down.



the technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture. And at the core of Silicon Valley are certain self-mythologies and dictums: Everything is different now, data reigns supreme, today’s winners deserve to triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard yesterday’s conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.

The paradox, of course, is that Google’s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.

Google’s search results confirm the experience we have seen with teams worldwide over the last 10 years. It’s not the parts. It’s how the parts work together to support, encourage, and empower each other. Behavioral norms are always present on teams. The core question is, “are they working for you?” On most teams, the answer is—not as well as we like. The team conversation starts a process of looking at how the team interacts and where the team wants to improve. This leads to action, practice, and learning.
